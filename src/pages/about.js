              Hey, I am Samantha. I was born and raised in Oakland, California.
              I am a first-gen college graduate from UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering
              and Computer Science. I am highly interested in robotics and user interface
              (UI) design.  I am currently in search of a full-time
              position as a software engineer in a place that fosters innovation and creativity.
              I enjoy working with others and want to find a place where collaboration is encouraged.

              I am super grateful that I found the robotics community at UC Berkeley.
              College can be overwhelming and a never-ending cycle of readings and study
              sessions, but it was through robotics that I got hands-on experience. I
              participated in combat robotics with an amazing club on campus called Robobears.
              I got the opportunity to travel to New York for the first time and fight robots,
              two of my lifelong goals! I was given the opportunity to be facilator for a class about 
              manficutring and designing robots for three years and was the president of the robotics club 
              for 2 years. I also got to work on big industry-standard robots
              during one of my favorite classes at Cal called 106a ü¶æ.

              Within my four years at UC Berkeley, I have taught STEM-related courses to both high school 
              and college students. I love being an engineer, and it is through education that I have the 
              power to motivate younger generations that engineering is for everyone, regardless of their 
              background. Getting your code to work after hours of debugging is such a rewarding feeling, 
              but seeing that through the eyes of a high schooler has been so inspirational. But most 
              importantly, I am passionate about creating a space for women of color to prosper in STEM. ‚ù§Ô∏è

            I like to believe that I am more than just who I am at school and work,
            although my family begs to differ lol. I love going on hikes ‚õ∞ and trying
            new food spots in the Bay Area, which is the best place to live for a foodie
            like me. I love spending time with my dog Nova, who is the most spoiled dog ever!üêæ
             Most importantly, I am a big family person. I am the eldest of 3 and have a big
            Hispanic family üá≤üáΩ, so we are always celebrating someone's birthday!
