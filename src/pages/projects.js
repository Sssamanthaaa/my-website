        I have a mixture of personal projects, academic projects, to curriculum projects. 
        They also range from independent, pair, to group projects. Some of the projects 
        have my code under a private repo and if you would like to see my work more 
        thoroughly feel free to reach out so I give you access. üòÅ         </p>

          incorporated AI to simplify packing and organize travel documents. I created a demo 
          video to showcase the product's goals and usability. My main contribution was designing 
          and implementing the documentation feature, which uses AI to scan and automatically 
          sort documents into their appropriate categories.`}

          hortiontal stack or vertical stack. My main contribution was the horizontal 
          stacking, this was a big issue for us because we had to make sure that the 
          gripper didnt get hit or move other blocks as it attempted to place another block.`}
